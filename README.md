# ðŸ“¸ screenshot: Better macOS screenshots via the Terminal

`screenshot` is a command line utility that lets you specify an *application name* and *window title* in order to take a screenshot of a specific window.

Using `screenshot`, you can capture windows belonging to an application, or only an application's windows with certain titles.

## Justification and Use Case
The macOS `screencapture` utility is not developer friendly. 

To programmatically take a screenshot of an application, or a specific window, you must supply a *window ID* to `screencapture`.
In order to find a window's *window ID*, you'll need call out to Quartz.

In newer versions of macOS, the `screencapture` utility improves the user experience slightly: you can run the command and then click on the window you'd like to capture.

However, that necessitates that the user clicks a window each time. You cannot include this as part of an automated pipeline.

To that end, I use this utility to automatically generate screenshots of web, mobile and desktop applications.

## Example
Take a screenshot of the current Terminal window and view it with Preview.app:
```bash
open "`screenshot Terminal`"
```

Take a screenshot of the Pycharm application with the *window title* containing "screenshot":
```bash
screenshot Pycharm -t screenshot
```
