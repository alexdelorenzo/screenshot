## Better macOS Screencaptures via the Terminal

`screenshot` is a command line utility that lets you specify an *application name* and *window title* to take a screenshot of a specific window.

## Justification and Use Case
The macOS `screencapture` utility is not developer friendly. 

To programmatically take a screenshot of an application, or a specific window, you must supply a *window ID* to `screencapture`.
In order to find a window's *window ID*, you'll need call out to Quartz.

In newer versions of macOS, the `screencapture` utility improves the user experience slightly: you can run the command and then click on the window you'd like to screenshot.
However, this necessitates that the user clicks a window each time. You cannot include this as part of an automated pipeline.

To that end, I use this utility to automate the generation of screenshots of web, mobile and desktop applications.

## Example
Take a screenshot of the Pycharm application with the *window title* containing "screenshot".

`screenshot Pycharm -t screenshot`

## PyPI
`pip3 install screenshot`
